# datawork
collection of work performed in pursuit of a career in Data Science

Currently attending a PGP at University of Texas for Data Analytics.  Here are a collection of a few of the acedemic projects I have worked on in python.

This is a work in progress and I will be uploading projects as time permits.

Academic Projects:

Project 5 Supervised Learning - Ensamble Techniques

On going

Project 4 Supervised Learning - Classification
AllLife Bank Personal Loan Modeling - Supervised Learning – Classification • AllLifeBank dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. • Logistic regression, multicollinearity, finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, pruning

Project 3  Supervised learning Foundations
Cars4U Project - Supervised Learning - Foundations • Using Cars4U dataset, need to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.
EDA, Linear regression, Linear regression assumptions, business insights and suggestions

Project 2 
Axis Health Insurance (Business Statistics) • This project uses statistical analysis and visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, BMI, age, gender, etc., and checks statistical evidences to make valuable decisions of insurance businesses like charges for health insurance. • Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Statistical InferenceAxis Health Insurance (Business Statistics) • This project uses statistical analysis and visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, BMI, age, gender, etc., and checks statistical evidences to make valuable decisions of insurance businesses like charges for health insurance. • Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference

Project 1 Python Foundations
Cardio Fitness Product Analysis using Python -Python Foundations • Cardio fitness data of about 180 people were provided using various cardio fitness products. The objective was to study and analyze which of the products is effective in terms of fitness and usage. The project involved interpretation of statistical output to generate managerial recommendations, using regression as a prediction device and most importantly evaluating and choosing of alternative statistical models. • Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis, Python, Missing Value Treatment, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification)
